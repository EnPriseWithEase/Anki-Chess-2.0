## Getting started

In order to install and later upgrade, you'll need to first install an Anki add-on called [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki):

1. Open Anki on your computer, go to the _Tools_ menu and select _Add-ons_.
1. In the dialog box, click on _Get Add-ons..._ and paste in the code provided on [this page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778).
1. Click on _OK_ to install the add-on, and then restart Anki.

You're now ready to install:

1. Go to the **[_Releases_ page](https://github.com/TowelSniffer/Anki-Chess-2.0/releases)**.
1. In the latest release's _Downloads_ section, download the ZIP archive of the deck. you can also install one of the premade shared decks within the "shared decks" zip.
1. Extract the content of the archive on your computer.
1. Open Anki and make sure your devices are all synchronised.
1. In the _File_ menu, select _CrowdAnki: Import from disk_.
1. Browse for and select the folder you extracted from the archive, which contains the deck's JSON file -- e.g. `chess`.
1. Don't change anything in the _CrowdAnki Import Settings_ dialog box that opens -- just press _OK_ to start the import. A dialog box should then confirm that the import was successful.

## Upgrading

The upgrade process is typically the same as the installation process explained in the [previous section](#getting-started). However, some situations require extra care. As a general rule, **always read the release notes carefully**; they will likely tell you what to do or point you to a page that does.
