# Anki-Chess-2.0
An interactive chess template for anki. 


## Getting started

- Create a new note type and copy the relavent template frome the Templates folder of this repository into each section. "Opponent Moves First" is for PGN puzzles that begin after the opponents move and "Opponest Moves First" is for PGN puzzles that begin on the first move. Styling is the same for both templtes.
- This note type should contain a field named PGN. 
- create a PGN puzzle using a PGN viewer, for example https://www.chess.com/analysis, and copy the PGN into the PGN field in anki.
- Done!

## Sharing your own decks

You are welcome to share your own premade decks for others to use. to do this export your deck as CrownAnki json representaion and uncheck the include media option. media will have to be included in a seperate zip file and imported manually. see the shared lichess study for an example.
